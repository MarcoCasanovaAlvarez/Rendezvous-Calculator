% The following script can be use to study the trade-off between wait time and
% DeltaV for a coplanar rendezvouz for any orbit in any planet. DeltaV
% estimated is for Chemical Propulsion, using a Hohmann transfer, but can
% be change in the code for Electrical Propulsion (in that case it would be
% needed as well a change in the TOF of the maneuver). 

% The input parameters are the orbit of the rendezvous, the orbit of the
% spacecrafts who wants to perform the rendezvous (or a range to study the
% variations of DeltaV and Wait time), the standard gravitational parameter
% of the planet and the initial angle between both vehicles.

% NOTE: Wait time for the same orbit is infinit. To represent well the wait
% time, a ylim in the plot was added.

%Script based on the equations of "Maneuvering In Space" - FAA
